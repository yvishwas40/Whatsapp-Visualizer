# Whatsapp Visualizer

> “Necessity is the mother of inventions.”

> When you lose every single way to solve a problem, your brain starts creating a new way that has never been paved before.

After I lost all my WhatsApp data with no backup for my drive, nor any local storage, those empty chats (all cleared) haunted me badly. Then a thought struck — why not create a new way of retrieving chats?

That’s when the idea of Whatsapp Visualizer was born.

For my good, WhatsApp has a feature of exporting chats (with or without media). But there was no proper tool to use those exports to get back the memories the way they originally appeared.

The idea was simple:

- Map the timelines
- Reconstruct the messages
- Re-link media file names

…all to render a chat that resembles the exact WhatsApp-like UI.

And yes — it worked! ✨ Now all my memories are retrieved back.

Thanks to those chat exports — go through them, and you’ll understand the soul of this project.
